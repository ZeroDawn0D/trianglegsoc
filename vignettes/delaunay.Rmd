# Discussion

The problem asks to draw 3 triangles among 5 points. I assume the correct way to do it would be to calculate the Constrained Delauney Triangulation of the 5 points.

A workaround I use is to limit the number of triangles to 3 like

``` r
trianglegsoc::run_DT(limit = 3)
```

However, this solution is only temporary, as some exceptions break it

```{r break}
trianglegsoc::run_DT(
  limit = 3, 
  input = matrix(c(5,6,8,2,9,1,7,9,2,4), ncol = 5, byrow = FALSE))

```

There are three triangles drawn, but point 3 has been completely skipped over
